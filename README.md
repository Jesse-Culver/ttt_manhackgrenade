# ttt_manhackgrenade
A grenade weapon for TTT that spawns manhacks when it goes off

You can set the number that spawn using "ttt_manhackgrenade_count", by default it is 10.

This is an old item I had from years back that I came across and decided to update. I can't remember if I made it or if it was someone else's that I modified so if you think you know the original author drop their workshop link and I'll add it in here.

Requires CSS but you should already have that if you are playing TTT.
